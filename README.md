# JavaScript-In-Easy-Steps
Worked through the book for supplemental learning

During the the time I was working on the rock, paper, scissors project, I was noticing I was challenged and entering a fog where I was not comprehending or understanding how to do the project correctly. I decided to take a pause and supplement my learning with severl other resources. This is one of them. So far, its been more of a review than anything else. Being so new, I am happy to review and grateful to lean a new prespective of how to write JavaScript.
